# COMPUTER HARDWARE & SOFTWARE.

## What is a Computer?

- A **Computer** is an electronic device that accepts user **input** (data) and **processes** it under the influence of a set of instructions referred to as programs to produce the desired **output** generally referred to as information (Mugivane, 2014).

### Basic Functionalities of Computers

- A computer must have all of the different components that enables a computer to _take input_, _process data_, _present outputs_, and _store information_.

| INPUTS                                                      | PROCESS                                                                                 | OUTPUTS                                                                                                                            | STORAGE                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| These are **data** given to the computer system from a user | **Processes** the data and converts it into useful information for the computer to use. | Once inputs have been processed, and now are ready to be **presented** to the user, the information will be outputted to the user. | Stores the **data/instructions** in its memory and use them when required. |

## Computer Hardware

- The **Computer Hardware** is a component of a computer system that which provides the physical mechanisms to input and output data, to manipulate and process data, and to electronically control the various input, output, and storage components (Englander, 2010).

## Reaction/Analysis

Computers have revolutionize the daily lives of humans. From improving all processes of work in the field of business to improving the quality of education. Moreover, computers have also improved communication. Technology has been made simpler in daily life to solve complex tasks that will otherwise take more time to achieve. They also reduce the mistakes that humans commit while calculating ensuring that the solutions they provide are accurate and reliable most importantly in areas like health care and engineering. They also provide knowledge to a broad range of people for the purpose of learning, innovating, and thinking. Considering computers play a vital role in our lives, it is also important to study and learn how and why they work.

Two important components of the computers are the hardware and the software. Hardware refers to the physical elements of a computer, among which are a processor, memory, and storage devices together working to process and store data. The processor is essentially the brain of a computer, carrying out the execution of instructions at incredibly high speeds. On the contrary, software refers to programs and applications that give out instructions to the hardware regarding what to do. The operating system is the most fundamental software layer: that is, either like Windows or macOS, it represents the core for managing resources on hardware while running other software. Applications enable users to perform a variety of tasks, from browsing the internet to efficiently complete tasks.

In conclusion, computers have fundamentally changed the way we live, work, and connect. As technology continues to evolve, understanding how computers function and mastering their use becomes increasingly essential. Embracing this knowledge empowers us to harness their full potential in our personal and professional lives.
